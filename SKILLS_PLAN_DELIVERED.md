## 🎯 The Concept: Skills System

### What Are Skills?

**Skills** are specialized domain expertise areas that Vivek activates to provide professional-grade output. Instead of generic "modes," Vivek becomes an expert in specific domains.

### The 7 Core Skills

**Language Skills** (3):
- **Python** - Pythonic code, type hints, PEP 8
- **TypeScript** - Type safety, React, Node.js
- **Go** - Concurrency, performance, idioms

**Role Skills** (4):
- **Coder** - Pragmatic, simple, testable code
- **Architect** - System design, scalability, documentation
- **Test Engineer** - Rigorous testing, comprehensive coverage
- **Code Reviewer** - Constructive feedback, learning-focused

### Key Innovation: Traits

Each skill has **traits** (characteristics) that drive:
1. **What the LLM focuses on** - Language idioms, testing rigor, etc.
2. **How the LLM behaves** - Temperature, model preference, etc.
3. **How quality is evaluated** - Skill-specific criteria

### Key Innovation: Composition

Skills can be **composed in sequences**:
```
architect → coder → test_engineer → code_reviewer

Each builds on previous, validates compatibility
```
