1. ‚úÖ **LangGraph orchestration is solid** - State management, iteration, persistence all working
2. ‚úÖ **Dual-brain architecture is sound** - Planner/Executor separation is effective
3. ‚úÖ **Test coverage is good** - 20+ tests with proper mocking and structure
4. ‚úÖ **CLI UX is polished** - Rich formatting, mode switching, nice help text

### **What Needs Immediate Attention:**
1. üî¥ **Prompt optimization** - Current bottleneck for smaller models
2. üî¥ **Error handling** - Silent failures are confusing for users
3. üî¥ **Real model testing** - All tests use mocks, need validation with actual models
4. üî¥ **File operations** - Can't edit code without file tools

### **Strategic Recommendations:**
1. **Keep 7B as default** - 3B is minimum, 7B is sweet spot for quality
2. **Optimize prompts first** - Biggest impact for least effort
3. **Test with real models early** - Avoid surprises later
4. **File operations before features** - Can't be a coding assistant without editing code
5. **Document as you go** - Update CLAUDE.md and README.md with learnings

### **Lessons from Analysis:**
- LangGraph already solves external memory/RAG needs
- SqliteSaver is more elegant than custom memory stores
- Context management is about prompts, not architecture
- Testing with real models should happen earlier
- 1B-3B might be too small for quality coding assistance

## üìù MAINTENANCE NOTES

**This TODO.md should be updated:**
- After completing each major task (mark with ‚úÖ)
- When priorities change based on learnings
- When new requirements emerge from testing
- When version roadmap shifts

**Current Status:** Updated 2025-10-04 to include TUMIX-inspired enhancements:
- Added 6 new advanced features from TUMIX lessons (Dynamic Agent Diversity, Tool-Augmented Execution, Iterative Message Passing, Principled Termination, Consensus Voting, Automatic Evolution)
- Prioritized Tool-Augmented Execution as critical for actual code editing capabilities
- Extended Phase 4 timeline to accommodate advanced agent features
- Updated success metrics and version roadmap accordingly
