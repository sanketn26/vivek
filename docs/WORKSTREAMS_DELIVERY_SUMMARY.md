## 🎯 Key Findings: What's Missing (Now Provided)

### Top 5 Missing Features (Now in Workstreams 5-9)

1. **Skills System** (WS5) - Transform from generic to specialized
   - Problem: Generic code generation
   - Solution: Language + role-based expertise
   - Impact: Expert-level code quality

2. **Multi-turn Memory** (WS6) - Context across requests
   - Problem: Vivek forgets context
   - Solution: Session-based persistent memory
   - Impact: Coherent multi-step projects

3. **Advanced Workflows** (WS7) - Parallel execution and branching
   - Problem: Linear execution only
   - Solution: LangGraph decision graphs
   - Impact: 50% faster execution

4. **Real LLM Testing** (WS8) - Production validation
   - Problem: Only mock LLMs
   - Solution: Integration with real providers
   - Impact: Proven performance

5. **Code Validation** (WS9) - Quality assurance
   - Problem: No validation tools
   - Solution: Real linting, typing, testing
   - Impact: Production-ready code

- ✅ Testing strategy with example tests
- ✅ File structure and organization
- ✅ Integration points
- ✅ Success criteria
- ✅ Deliverables checklist

**Example**: Workstream 5 includes:
- Domain models (`Skill`, `Trait`, `QualityRubric`)
- Registry and loader classes
- All 7 skills defined in YAML
- CLI command implementation
- Test examples
- Total: ~150+ lines of specification code

---

## 🌟 Why These Workstreams?

### Why Workstream 5 (Skills) is #1 Priority
1. **Highest ROI** - Transforms generic → specialized
2. **Complete spec** - Already designed and documented
3. **No blockers** - Can start immediately
4. **Major differentiator** - Sets Vivek apart from competitors
5. **Foundation** - Enables all other advanced features

### Why in This Order?
```
Skills (5) → Context (6) → Workflows (7) → LLM (8) → Validation (9)
    ↓           ↓            ↓               ↓           ↓
Specialization Memory    Efficiency    Production   Quality
```

Each builds on the previous.
