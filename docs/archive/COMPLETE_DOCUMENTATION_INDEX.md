   - Where to put new code
   - Decision tree for folder placement
   - Common tasks (add mode, provider, quality criterion)
   - Import cheat sheet
   - File templates

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis (Before Week 1 Coding)

5. **[CRITICAL_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md](CRITICAL_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md)** üî¥ CRITICAL - READ BEFORE CODING
   - 15 critical gaps identified
   - API contracts missing
   - Error handling strategy needed
   - Prompt templates needed

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale | Document |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Architecture Pattern** | Clean Architecture (DDD) | Separation of concerns, testability | Folder Organization |
| **Implementation Approach** | Vertical slices (not layers) | Always integrated, lower risk | Migration Roadmap |
| **Scope** | Minimal v4.0.0 (2 modes) | Ship in 8 weeks, iterate later | Migration Roadmap |
| **File Operations** | Python stdlib (pathlib, subprocess) | No external dependencies, cross-platform | Tools Integration |
| **Tool Type** | Standalone CLI (not VSCode extension) | Flexible, any editor | Tools Integration |
| **Vector Search** | Defer to v4.1.0 | Reduce v4.0.0 complexity | Vector Storage |

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Version |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Language** | Python | 3.11+ |
| **LLM Provider (v4.0.0)** | Ollama | Local |
| **File Operations** | pathlib, subprocess | stdlib |
| **Configuration** | YAML + Pydantic | - |
| **CLI Framework** | Typer + Rich | - |
| **Testing** | pytest + pytest-cov | - |
| **AST (v4.1.0+)** | libcst, tree-sitter | Future |
| **Templates (v4.1.0+)** | Jinja2 | Future |
| **Vector Search (v4.1.0+)** | sqlite-vec + sentence-transformers | Future |

### 2. üî¥ Create Error Handling Guide

**File**: `docs/ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md`

**Contents**:
- Exception hierarchy
- Retry strategy
- Error propagation
- User-facing error messages

**Estimated Time**: 0.5 days

### 3. üî¥ Create Prompt Library

**File**: `docs/PROMPT_LIBRARY.md`

**Contents**:
- Actual prompt text (not just placeholders)
- Planner system & user prompts
- Executor prompts (coder mode, sdet mode)
- Quality evaluation prompts
- Prompt versioning strategy

**Estimated Time**: 1 day

### 4. üî¥ Create Testing Strategy

**File**: `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`

**Contents**:
- Unit test approach
- Integration test scenarios
- Mock LLM strategy (fixtures)
- Performance benchmarks
- Test data & fixtures

**Estimated Time**: 0.5 days

### 5. üî¥ Update DI Container Specification

**File**: `docs/DEPENDENCY_INJECTION.md`

**Contents**:
- How services are registered
- Dependency graph
- Configuration injection
- Lifecycle management

**Estimated Time**: 0.5 days

**Total Estimated Time**: 3.5 days

## Common Questions & Answers

### Q1: Where do I start coding?

**A**: Don't start coding until you've:
1. Read Migration Roadmap, Tools Integration, Folder Organization
2. Created the 5 missing documents (API Contracts, etc.)
3. Set up folder structure
4. Written data models

Start with: `src/vivek/domain/models/work_item.py`

### Q2: What if I need to add a new feature?

**A**: Use the decision tree in [QUICK_REFERENCE_V4_STRUCTURE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE_V4_STRUCTURE.md):
- Business logic? ‚Üí domain/
- Orchestration? ‚Üí application/orchestrators/
- External integration? ‚Üí infrastructure/
- User interface? ‚Üí presentation/cli/

### Q3: How do I handle errors?

**A**: Wait for ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md (to be created), but general pattern:
```python
from vivek.domain.exceptions import ExecutionException

try:
    result = executor.execute(work_item)
except ExecutionException as e:
    logger.error(f"Execution failed: {e}")
    # Retry or fail gracefully
```

### Q4: Should I use vector search in v4.0.0?

**A**: No, defer to v4.1.0. See [VECTOR_STORAGE_STRATEGY.md](VECTOR_STORAGE_STRATEGY.md) for rationale.

### Q5: How do I test without real LLM calls?

**A**: Use MockProvider with fixtures. See TESTING_STRATEGY.md (to be created).

### Q6: What's the release timeline?

**A**: 8 weeks from Week 1 start. See [MIGRATION_ROADMAP_V3_TO_V4.md](MIGRATION_ROADMAP_V3_TO_V4.md) for weekly breakdown.
