# Vivek v4.0.0 Implementation Guide - Start Here

**Last Updated**: October 22, 2025
**Timeline**: 8 weeks
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

---

## Overview

This guide organizes v4.0.0 implementation into **4 focused workstreams**. Each workstream has its own detailed document.

---

## Implementation Order

Follow these workstreams in order:

### ðŸ“‹ [WORKSTREAM 1: Foundation & Contracts](WORKSTREAM_1_FOUNDATION.md) (Week 1-2)
**What**: Core interfaces, data models, error handling
**Deliverables**:
- API contracts (interfaces)
- Data models (WorkItem, ExecutionResult, etc.)
- Exception hierarchy
- Configuration system
- Basic file operations

**Start Here** â†’ This sets up everything else

---

### ðŸ§  [WORKSTREAM 2: Core Services](WORKSTREAM_2_CORE_SERVICES.md) (Week 3-5)
**What**: Planning, execution, and quality services
**Deliverables**:
- Planner service (decompose requests)
- Executor service with 2 modes (Coder, SDET)
- Quality service (evaluate outputs)
- Dependency resolution

**Depends On**: Workstream 1 complete

---

### ðŸ”„ [WORKSTREAM 3: Orchestration & Integration](WORKSTREAM_3_ORCHESTRATION.md) (Week 5-6)
**What**: Tie services together, iteration logic
**Deliverables**:
- Dual-brain orchestrator
- Iteration manager
- Project context builder
- End-to-end integration

**Depends On**: Workstream 2 complete

---

### ðŸŽ¨ [WORKSTREAM 4: CLI & Polish](WORKSTREAM_4_CLI_POLISH.md) (Week 7-8)
**What**: User interface, documentation, release
**Deliverables**:
- CLI commands with progress display
- Configuration management
- Examples and documentation
- Testing (100+ tests)
- v4.0.0 release

**Depends On**: Workstream 3 complete

---

## Success Metrics

From v3.0.0 â†’ v4.0.0:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Files per request | 1 | 3-5 | 5x |
| Test inclusion | 0% | 80% | âˆž |
| Syntax errors | ~25% | <5% | 80% reduction |
| Has quality gate | No | Yes | New feature |
| Execution time | 12s | 30-45s | Acceptable trade-off |

## Before You Start

### Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Read this index file (you're here!)
- [ ] Read [Workstream 1: Foundation](WORKSTREAM_1_FOUNDATION.md)
- [ ] Understand the folder structure
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create skeleton folders

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone repo
cd /home/sanket/workspaces/vivek

# Create virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Type check
mypy src/
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to read all old documents?

**A**: No! The 4 workstream documents consolidate everything you need.

Old documents (reference only if needed):
- `MIGRATION_ROADMAP_V3_TO_V4.md` - High-level overview
- `TOOLS_AND_FILE_INTEGRATION.md` - Deep dive on file operations
- `FOLDER_ORGANIZATION_V4.md` - Complete folder structure
- `CRITICAL_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md` - Risks identified

### Q: What if I get stuck?

**A**: Each workstream document has:
- Detailed code examples
- Troubleshooting section
- Decision trees

### Q: Can I work on multiple workstreams in parallel?

**A**: No. Complete workstreams sequentially:
1. Foundation first (Week 1-2)
2. Then Core Services (Week 3-5)
3. Then Orchestration (Week 5-6)
4. Finally CLI & Polish (Week 7-8)

### Q: What about vector storage / semantic search?

**A**: Defer to v4.1.0 (see `VECTOR_STORAGE_STRATEGY.md` for details)
